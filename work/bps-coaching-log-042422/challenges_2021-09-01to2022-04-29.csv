Briefly describe challenges in the classroom and/or your interaction with the instructional team in this session:
none as of now
"lengthy whole group time in one classroom that required children to wait extensively
lead teacher in one classroom had to leave early to bring her daughter to the doctor"
"the program is short staffed, so I wasn't able to meet with the second teacher"
staffing-second teacher assigned to the classroom is leaving. The lead teacher is stressed by this. The classroom will need to move downstairs to accommodate the substitute who will be working with them.
Challenges in the classroom for the teachers was that there were children who were not engaging.  Class seemed to need more support in classroom management.
lead teacher defensive during feedback about some of the words she uses/interactions with children (e.g. play is for babies. You are big 3 and 4 year olds).
second teacher is new and needs more coaching on taking initiative and leading the group for whole group components
"the new second teacher in the room was let go the morning of the observation. The person hired to be the third teacher/floater, will take her place"
Two classrooms need more support in classroom management.  We are working on supporting those teachers so they can get deeper in the quality of teaching the curriculum.
Sherley has two children in her classroom that are being referred to for services.  She also has 7 children who are English Language Learners.  
Ms. Green has some challenging behaviors in here classroom.  She has connected with Cassandra and Jennifer from RS.  Jennifer is going to come in and do social stories with the class.  
N/A 
Half of the class is English Language Learners in their room.  
N/A 
There are lots of moving parts to the day.  The teachers expressed the need to continue looking more at Heggerty due to it being knew.  They feel they are overwhelmed.  
staffing-there is a temporary staff person serving as the second teacher
they didn't attend the Heggerty training...have been watching some of the videos
Team has been in place for awhile and complacency sets in. Working on cleaning and organizing environment. There was no break between summer and school year
Not all center areas are open.  Ms. T felt she needed to have structures in place and wanted to introduce them gradually.  She introduced block area during small groups.  I nicely encouraged her to quickly introduce all centers because this is a key part of the focus curriculum! 
"Classroom 6 is still looking for a full time second teacher. Peg is substituting for now. The classroom has been moved downstairs to accommodate Peg (stairs were too much). Nefira doesn't seem to be involved in the services being offered to her children-in the decision making/intake process or in consultation with outside service providers (e.g mental health, speech). This has been a source of frustration for her."
"staffing shortage has been a challenge at the program, making it difficult for me to meet with both members of the teaching team"
Working on environment/ classroom and organization
"The instructional teams class is half ELL.  This is challenging for the teachers and children during the daily routines, structures. "
The classroom does not have the read aloud books for them to begin the curriculum.  We did speak with Arlene the director and Claudine was sending her the book list to order.  Claudine dropped off Peter's Chair and Oonga Boonga for them to get started.  
Our debrief was via zoom due to coverage not being available for us to meet in person.
"They have not started curriculum yet.  RA text have not been ordered.  Some of the activities were not developmentally appropriate, there was not choose for where children wanted to go. Children were made to rotate through every centers every 15 minutes. Height of furniture was too high in blocks, DP.  They have a giant teacher desk in the room that needs to be removed.  A more clear set up for centers needs to be created (library, art easel).  No schedule posted, most of circle time area wall area has large calendar, months of the year, days of the week etc.  Staff/children interaction were weak. Work on walls was the same thing (This is my mom, This is my grandparent, this is me etc).  "
managing behavior can take up time during whole group meetings. We talked about ways to prevent behavior that can be disruptive and about taking a temperature check on the whole group-are most kids paying attention? Is a wiggly kid really distracting others?
"the second teacher has been absent for 2 weeks and the teacher has been teaching on her own. teacher practice in terms of tone, support for transitions, wait time when asking questions is sometimes concerning "
The challenges are that the teachers do not have time to plan with one another.  I will talk to admin about that so they can have a more cohesive work experience for each other.
Thinking about integrating Hebrew supports into Focus (ie. start with Read Aloud and vocabulary cards)
some resistance to feedback about the length of the whole group meeting time
There were no challenges during our meeting.
difficult to meet with all 3 teachers because of break schedules and staffing challenges (absent staff in other classrooms)
There is a buckling in the floor in their room which is getting worse and affects the layout. No response from landlord to repair. Will follow up after the holidays
moved ahead and started unit 3 without an extension week
There are none.  
"There have been covid, out of state visitors, and holidays that have caused a slow up in coaching this year."
"due to staffing shortage, the second teacher couldn't join the debrief session"
"The teaching team is comprised of 3 new educators. The teacher with the most experience is not the LT but the L teacher. The LT seemed distant and hesitant to in my initial observation. However, after watching a video of me modeling intro to centers she opened up a bit. "
"I observed during an extension week, so didn't see the curriculum being implemented fully, but practices were in place"
The debrief occurred once the students were napping so it was successful in the fact that both teachers were able to sit and share out their experiences as well as ask questions about the current unit.
none
"There were two substitute teachers in the room. Despite this, the level of instruction is strong and classroom is well organized."
time for the teaching team to plan curriculum activities each week....they are scheduled to start planning together on Fridays during Rest time starting next week
I observed the second teacher facilitating a Heggerty/Concepts of print lesson. Both teachers became defensive about feedback related to Heggerty implementation.
There we no challenges. The team was extremely receptive and excited about our next steps for implementing the curriculum. 
The teacher does not currently have the Building Blocks curriculum or some of the materials needed for centers. 
This classroom does not have seats and is in year one. Focus has been EEC licensing but starting to work in classroom. Vast improvement in classroom layout since beginning of the year
Lisa is no longer the lead teacher in this room.  She has gone to a non UPK prek classroom as an instructional lead.  Kari has taken on the role as the UPK lead teacher and is learning how to be the lead as she also helps a new teacher who joined the classroom a week prior.  They also have a few students that they have some wonderings around their behaviors and cognition.
Using a progress monitoring tool or observation notes to track children's trajectories and use them to be reflective about their teaching so they can differentiate for the needs of the students.
"The challenges that the classrooms had since December was staff absences, covid closing classrooms, and the number of students going to school was a lot less due to various things.  Since February things have turned around and things are getting back to normal.  "
Classroom management during this component was minimal.  There wasn't a concrete way to gather the children to the rug to start the protocol.  It took 16 minutes to get a majority of children together.  Children seemed to not really understand and were engaged with other materials around the carpet.  
Influx of children arriving at different times throughout the morning so the teachers were pulled to different areas to assist students with arrival routines and making center choices.
"Was not able to debrief with the lead teacher due to timing. However, I met with the administrative team who will pass the debrief information to the teacher."
lead teacher needed to leave the room for an impromptu parent meeting for first 1/2 hour
"Peyton, the 3rd teacher, was absent
some resistance to adding sensory play because children have colds"
"
I observed read aloud on Friday, 3/25 and we met via zoom on Monday 3/28. After debriefing about the read aloud, I addressed concerns about the length of time the children were on the rug following the read aloud (60+minutes). The length of teacher directed time has been an ongoing concern. 
The teaching team still does not have a consistent time to meet and plan
"
The team was very informative of the usual behaviors they notice with a particular student and allowed me to observe the child from afar.  The teachers did their usual routines and made noticings while I was there and briefed me during my visit.
"Teaching team is not as nervous and trust is being built 
"
N/A. 
There has been some tension between the two teachers.  We worked through some of this.  Nikki is still trying to figure out her role and would like more directive support from Regina.  
As I mentioned in previous notes lead teacher and 2nd teacher have been disagreeing on some things in the classrooms.  They are still working through this.  Lead Teacher has told me she is thinking about leaving the Y and exploring other options.  They also have not been getting planning time.  
Since the lead teacher has left the second teacher will be stepping in as the lead until the position is filled.  
Since the lead teacher left in January the classroom has fallen apart.  The director told the 2nd teacher not to do curriculum.  Which we had discussed prior not to do. The environment is not clean and items are everywhere.   
"The second teacher is very upset with leadership and lack of communication, trust, lack of cooperation, and respict.  This has caused various issues in the classroom between the teacher who is in the room.  She is unsure of her position at the Y.  "
teachers are frustrated with admin in various ways.  They have been asked to be coleads and are not understanding what that mean. The environment is a major issue with things still being tossed and not cleaned.  
"none.. Just starting, gaining their trust"
none
Nikki does not seem happy with having a co-lead teacher.  
"Nikki the teacher who has been in the room expressed to me and Linda she did not feel part of the process of moving the environment even though she was helping and there as we moved things.  She said she did not understand why the environment needed to be changed. We explained there were not defined areas, with wide open spaces and things were not spread out and materials did not have a specific place.  Children were not using materials properly and lack of classroom management, curriculum and the environment had a lot to do with this.  "
Nikki seems to be not want to be coached.  She says her frustration is with the Y and not coaching but this is effecting coaching.  
"During the debrief Nikki was on her phone, not listening to questions Clyte was asking or what the discussion was.  She kept jumping in and talking about things that were not relevant to the conversation or things she half heard.  This was extremely frustrating.  She kept saying Clyte does not know the curriculum.  Clyte does know the curriculum just not well, she was in the room part time before Regina left.  Nikki also kept saying she was in the room with Regina when they got 5s on their fidelity and was dismissive when I was walking them through it.  "
In K1 A there are multiple children who are in need of one on one attention.    
Classroom behavior problems are disrupting the schedule and routines of the day.  
Behavior still is an issue in K1B she said admin refuses to come in the room and remove the child from her room when he is being destructive and unsafe.  She has been logging his behavior to share with his mom.  She has a meeting with her before the vacation.  
N/A 
K1 A has since had their assistant removed and placed in the infant room.  The amera corp volunteer is the assistant in the room but is not helping out as the assistant and Latasha said she seems to get upset when she is trying to guide her.  This is causing her to be very stressed.  
n/a 
N/A 
Sherley has two children in her classroom who are in need of special education evaluations. One the parents are on board and the other does not want the child to be tested.  There are significant delays in both children.  
not being able to go into the program is a challenge.  
This is the third teacher in classroom this school year. She has only been there a week. I wanted to introduce myself and just check in.
No challenges to be noted since the teacher is eager to implement the curriculum at a pace that begins portion of it this spring and full in the Fall.
