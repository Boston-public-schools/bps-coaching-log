Briefly describe challenges in the classroom and/or your interaction with the instructional team in this session:
current situation with regards to health and safety regulations/EEC guidelines
the Educational Supervisor brought up a few issues that pertain to the center/program and aren't specific to the needs of this classroom-I asked to schedule a separate meeting to address these
"Finding time for all 3 staff to be present. Because of COVID coverage, this could prove to be a challenge but we are working on it"
No challenges at all!
"Getting on Zoom, old laptop and nap time is only time where the two teachers overlap "
They stopped the video earlier than I anticipated. We had talked about me observing informally for at least 30 minutes. 
"MT. Pleasant notes 10.5.20 

Teachers do not have the capacity to go online and record video besides using their own phones. 
Susan mentioned that they (nurtury) has purchased laptops but have yet to arrive
Teachers mentioned that they have “Old Owl” curriculum books and not the current books
Teachers mentioned concerns about their pay if they’re getting paid more for working with UPK
Both teachers are taking the online focus course. However, they haven’t done much work. They mentioned that they will be doing the work. 
Teacher’s were not getting planning time. However, Dorothy mentioned that they will start getting planning time every wednesday from 2 to 3pm starting Oct 7. 
Susan mentioned that Nurtury is having some issues in regards to seesaw and setting up accounts for their families. 
Mt. Pleasant classroom has 12 students and none of them are remote. 
Team not familiar with Building Blocks 
Deliverables: 
Anthony will reach out to UPK admin team to ask about budgets and whether Mt.Pleasant got funding for laptops and curriculum. 
Anthony will reach out to UPK admin team and ask about setting up accounts with seesaw for UPK families. 
Dorothy and Mt pleasant team will share their current schedule with me. 
Winnerfried and Silvanna will think about how they prefer me to observe: 
Share a prerecorded video
Have me join a live zoom where I can observe particular sections of the classroom or a particular component. 
Share a video assignment that will be due for the online course but could also be used for coaching
"
time with coverage right now is tough (COVID coverage)
fewer children willing to return
The classroom has had to move to a new space temporarily due to a leak in the ceiling of their classroom. It has been challenging for them to set up the new space for instruction. Both teachers are brand new to UPK and are learning the curriculum as they teach it.
No problems.
The second teacher had questions about classroom management and getting children to engage with her intro to centers because she felt her timing and the children's focus took too long.
none
"I noticed that none of the children were wearing masks. Although they were distanced at tables, teacher was sometimes closer to them than 6 feet and she was wearing a mask. I inquired about this and suggested children should be wearing masks. No window open or fan for ventilation in use. Also suggested positioning of teacher and visual supports (chalk board and book) should be facing children at tables since no one is sitting at rug. Need to schedule whole body exercise and movement also was discussed. They had not been going outside or using gym. Since last meeting, they have gone outside but not for very long. "
"they are not really using building blocks-they have added a few activities, but haven't incorporated in into their weekly planning and implementation of curriculum"
The Director being in the background during the observation and debrief.  
none
COVID and inability to be in room and debrief during rest time can be tough
Going full remote and attempting to do dual language is a challenge
none
"none.. despite COVID health and safety, I was still able to observe a read aloud given with great fidelity and joy and interactions; "
bumpy start because of early dates for maternity leave and water main break disruption
covid 19 regulations 
"The children in classroom 1B are merging with the children in classroom 7. Roya, the lead teacher, will be teaching a different group of children remotely. Peg will be moving to working with children in the after school program."
The lead teacher expressed resistance to integrating building blocks into her small group time. The small group structure set up incorporates content that is not from Focus or BB. 
none
none.. such a pleasure to observe
"Time and schedule.  Also, there seem to be some team dynamics that I felt could be a problem of hearing everyone share their point of view."
There were none. They were all present.  We did have the debrief during rest time so it was very dark where they were in their classrooms.  But they were very receptive to our feedback and to seeing them in action again.
N/A 
Children having access to materials along with keeping social distancing and cleaning in the routine.
Mission Grammer suddenly went remote Tuesday night.  
none
none
none
Children are not as socially distant as teachers would like them to be during whole group instruction.  We talked about spreading them out more and having them sit on something to designate spots.  
none
Challenges are no laptops for either teacher. Borrowed or their own iPad or phone when doing Zoom. Internet is poor and needs an extender or booster
mentioned above.
The focus on the discussion was around adjusting the schedule and setting expectations for whole group rug times. 
"Have been doing set up for success...curriculum doesn’t start 
How deep...expectations, community building, problem solving, cozy corners...how many friends should be at each center…
Bin is used then cleaned...health and safety clean toys and materials then returns it at the end of the day…
Doing math….dividing materials would take over a week to prep for certain activities…
Each have their own art caddy, crayons, scissors, glue, etc
Kids can’t change and go to other centers…
"
Teaching team mentioned that a child was displaying some behavior issues and that the child's family was going to have them be evaluated. 
"Interactions are strong. Very receptive to feedback and asks good questions
Does a lot of background work; reading ahead, prepping, "
walking team through how to upload and share video seemed like a big issue....Teachers also seemed focus on a particular child's behavior but not necessarily how to address that behavior or support the child in gaining the skills they need. 
"space (as mentioned above) and limitations due to COVID (limited centers, children needing to stay in centers for longer periods of time, cleaning)"
Fidelity to Focus on K1 curriculum components.
continued clarification around the need to engage with all children in small group activities during the course of the week
We did not have a debrief that week due to teacher schedule. I did reach out to her to reschedule but have yet to hear from her.
I couldn't see Laura's group because the camera was focused on Sam and her group. I will observe Laura during the next visit.
"Protocols and policies around cleaning, sanitizing and centers needs clarification and concrete procedures in place"
none
none
internet kept kicking me off so we were interrupted a few times
none..
"consistent, dedicated planning & prep time "
none
one child had a difficult time with the clean up transition and was removed from the classroom for a walk
There are no challenges. 
"Three children in need of screening or speech
"
resistance to using the BB curriculum...not currently implementing small group activities as written
total enrollment is increasing (currently 15-going up to 18) which will make meeting OEC regs related to Covid very difficult to follow
There are no challenges or particular concerns to raise.
There were no challenges during this debrief.
The timing of the debrief was changed due to my being sick on the day that we were to debrief.  So we have rescheduled twice and should meet on Monday Dec 7th.
"I think for me the challenges is that I need to talk to one teacher more than the other about things that I see and how to guide that teacher to incorporate higher level vocabulary, challenges for students who can do more, and supports for students who need them."
"Though I have a strong relationship with the lead teacher (Cliff), my relationship with the second teacher (Jennifer) needs to get stronger. She is cautious or hesitant in opening up. She wasn't present at this meeting but this definitely needs to be a focus of my sessions for this year (strengthening my relationship with Jennifer). "
none
"The lead teacher, Cliff is always responsive to suggestions and feedback and we share a pretty strong coach to teacher relationship. However, Jennifer, the assistant teacher (soon to be lead teacher), is a bit timid, shy, and or cautious, and we have yet to establish a strong relationship.  In our last session, on Dec 3, and one of the only times that Jennifer really opened up, Jennifer shared that she felt hurt about Cliff leaving. She got really emotional and left the meeting abruptly. On this session, Jennifer refused to talk or share out. Cliff is leaving Ellis Memorial on Jan 1. "
none
none
they aren't formally using Building Blocks-they are implementing other related math activities
tech issues-audio stopped working after 10 mins
EEC and COVID numbers vs.UPK numbers and committed seats is an issue but it is EEC licensing that drives this conversation
"internet connection. I meet with this team every other Thursday. This has been an issue because 2 of our observations have now fallen on Holiday breaks (Nov 26/Dec 24). However, we did schedule 2 other observation sessions this month (Dec 4, Dec 5 looking at different components SWPL and Morning meeting). "
"The teacher talked at length about her frustrations in addressing behavioral challenges/needs of one student. I didn't see him being disruptive during my observation, although she had him move his seat for read aloud."
The second teacher Sharon is going to be out of the classroom for the month of December.  There is a new second teacher for that time named Diana Herrera.  There has been some time since our last observation.  I gave the team the reigns to confirm an observation date but they did not get back to me.  Will check in with the Director about the changes occurring there and the impact it may have.
Sometimes it is hard to follow when camera is fixed on one view. Could hear teacher but not see her.
"In my observation a saw a blend of remote and in person learning. I question the effectiveness of doing both in-person and remote learning simultaneously. I really wanted to talk through this with the teacher. However, the teacher was sent home due to having a soar throat. "
none

"Confirmed status os staff; Nicole is out on maternity leave, not sure when she is returning
Cecelia George is lead teacher but having surgery, Back after 12/25
Ashlee Price is asst. , filling in as lead right now"
none
Teachers are constantly struggling with fear of Covid and safety regulations.  They do not believe the Y is providing enough support or giving the correct information to them.  
Teachers believe the Y is not taking safety protocols serious.  They are very concerned for their health and the health of the children/families in the classroom.
small groups 
Currently no challenges. 
Teachers are challenged by children not consistency coming to zooms. 
School has been off and on remote and in person learning due to covid cases in school building. 
Challenges are the 2 at home learners and how to make them part of the classroom. 
Implementation of Heggerty during the day.  The are switching out SWPL for Heggerty but it is not enough time due to the teachers learning it.  
New teachers. The team is eager but in experienced. 
none
"The teacher had been in a car accident recently. She was experiencing anxiety and both having trouble completing some of the course assignments and forgetting songs in SWPL and other aspects of the day. We talked about taking time in the day to both relax and take a step back and breathe (15/20 mins), and to do some of the assignments (10 min) in pieces not to get too caught up in reading a whole article in one sitting. Also, creating a visual schedule for SWPL or other components so to not forget what is planned or coming next (e.g. a picture of a duck for the 5 little duck song, or a pictures of a frog for 5 green speckled frogs). "
none
Nothing from them.  Just feel like I could do more if I were in the room with them.
Nothing today.

Ashlee is subbing and not sure of future status of lead teacher
none
There were no challenges.
New team. New dynamics. 
mentioned above...
na
interactions with staff are good. Instruction is ongoing in terms of improvement. Few children in attendance
team recently enrolled a student or some students who have opted for remote learning. The teaching team decided to have all children attend certain components on their tablet. 
"Though teachers seem willing, they at times also seem confused about how to do certain things especially when it comes to classroom management. "
none.. 
Lead teacher leaving. 
morale is low. Both teachers expressed feeling like leaving the program. 
na
lead teacher was out for observation. 
one teacher is pretty open about sharing out needs and where he is. The other teacher is hesitant to share any information and is not very confident. 
N/A 
No challenge at this time.
There was a bit of push back on suggestions made by me in regards to if T&F was a time to pull out vocabulary from children or should that be done at the center through rich conversation or if there should be two students presenting their work within that 10 minute time frame.
audio quality-difficult to hear clearly at times
None
The teaching team is very receptive. There are no challenges at this time.
just tech issues with their computer for debrief...Nefira had to get very close to the computer for me to hear her
"Low enrollment. 9 enrolled but have never observed more than 3 in the classroom
One teacher in the room at a time"
"Most suggestions/encouragements given are met with resistance from the lead teacher. For example, when I encouraged them to use the small group record sheets or another form of documenting learning during small groups, she responded that she knows what kids can and can't do. There was also pushback around the structure of small group time (running 2 different teacher led groups at once)...hoping some of this can be addressed with ed supervisor and when coaching in person"
difficult to hear conversations between children and teachers
None
"Teachers are very aware of covid policies but are struggling to implement them at certain times of the day center, small groups. "
"Few children enrolled, more choice "

Just the spotty wifi.
None 
There was some wifi spottiness so hearing the interactions with the children was tough.
continued concerns about the challenging behavior of one child and how it interrupts learning/classroom functioning-not something I've seen in observations 
none
Some reluctance to have children act out their own stories...to try recommended protocols/routines for story acting

internet access on phones makes observation difficult
none
"We will continue to work on adjusting practice for students who need more support and others who are either adjusting with coming back to the classroom, or need more scaffolding."
None at the moment.
internet was spotty today so screen kept freezing. Not able to do debrief at noon because internet went down
There are no challenges at this time.
space and # of children with Covid restrictions
"team planning seems to be an issue. The visit was postponed from last week as the Assistant Teacher didn't have the book for the read aloud. The lead teacher did not attend the debrief because I had observed the Assistant reading. I need to follow up with both, together, on the importance of team prep and planning time and on the expectation that the lead teacher attend all debrief meetings."
Willfind ways to include other two asst. teachers  in debrief when they are with the children. Maybe once a month with all three staff at a different time of the day
There is a lack of collaboration and team work between the lead teacher and the assistant teacher. 
none
none
none
"It's unclear how much the lead teacher is committed to curriculum implementation. She received new teacher PD last year, but seems to be unfamiliar with a lot of the expectations and is not fully implementing curriculum components. She often pushes back on suggestions "
teacher seems hesitant to involve UPK related service staff in her work with this child and in making referrals in general. She seemed unaware of mental/behavioral health supports available for children and families in the program (I will follow up with admin next week)
"wifi, sharing videos, "
The team is having trouble sharing videos. 
...
Teaching team can be very controlling at times. 
none

small group-2 children attending regularly and both are English Language Learners-engagement can be challenging at times during remote learning
none
"internet during debrief was in and out, so we couldn't complete our discussion. Also, Nefira entered the meeting late because of coverage issues."
There have been scheduling changes frequently due to staff being out when observations or debriefs are scheduled.
At the moment the Dorchester classroom is moving to the new Roxbury site so we had to take pause on observations and debriefs.  
None
not clear if they are invested in story acting piece or clearly understand expectations-we made a plan for me to model story acting outside later in May
Using appropriate and efficient techniques to transition children from one activity to another. 
none
They are going to dedicate one day a week to planning but this is difficult because they are not receiving dedicated planning time together.  
Teachers expressed frustration with leadership.  They have concerns about covid regulations not being fully implemented within the program and are doing thier best to control it within their own classroom.

When talking to Shirley she seems very receptive to feedback but when following through she does not seem to misinterpret the feedback.  There is a slight language barrier. Her first language is Haitian Creole.

"the teacher often has questions about UPK PD-certificates, expectations, clarity around attendance, etc. It isn't a challenge with her so much, but I feel like we need a clear system in place around PD attendance, tracking, and certificates."
"the lead  teacher has not been very receptive to coaching and feedback overall
The second teacher has been out with Covid for about a month so it's been hard for her to manage everything. She has had an assistant teacher with her, but she speaks limited English"
difficult to see everything in classroom. Sometimes internet freezes
none
None.  Just WIFI issues: freezing and sporadic sound.
No challenges noted!
none
Both Shirley and Oneyda need things about curriculum repeated multiple times.  Sometimes they misinterpret things because they are both 2nd language learners.  They do better with items being modeled for them.

Classroom management and dealing with children who have behavior issues seems the main challenges in this classroom.
