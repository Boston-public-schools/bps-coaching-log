Briefly describe strengths in the classroom and/or your interaction with the instructional team in this session:
The team work that happens in the classroom is wonderful.  The teacher doing the lesson has a lot of energy and high expectations for her children while using age appropriate vocabulary.

interactions with children/relationships; working as a team; organized and intentional; receptive to feedback
the lead teacher and teacher are both skilled at asking questions to push children's thinking (e.g. explaining strategies during Building Blocks activities) and
well organized; both teachers are comfortable leading whole and small groups; greater receptivity to feedback during this session
Thoughtful implementation; strong team collaboration 
the team has begun consistently implementing building blocks small groups; they were more receptive to feedback

Taking the UMass course and looking at components. baby steps
Both the staff members in the classroom were very receptive to suggestions I had to begin to incorporate little pieces of the curriculum ( ie: continue with the read aloud and using the curriculum guide to support the questioning of the text)
The behaviors in K1A have become increasingly better.  The child who was having the behavior problems mom decided he needed another placement.  The home for little wonders is going to begin coming in and working with 5 other children who have trauma/stress per my recommendation to Sheila and Latasha.  Sheila is very excited about this!  They will begin this week.  
The teachers have continued the curriculum and are excited to begin Unit 5.  They have lots of extension activity for the unit.  They love the check in sessions from me.  They really are a high flying classroom and I believe only need check ins/curriculum planning not coaching of the curriculum.  
The environment is really working for the team.
