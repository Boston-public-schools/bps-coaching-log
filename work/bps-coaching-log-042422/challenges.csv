Briefly describe challenges in the classroom and/or your interaction with the instructional team in this session:
There are no challenges.
Classroom has had COVID and is housed in a building with upper grades who are not wearing masks. Observations have not happened. Prioritizing EEC licensing but starting to meet with teaching staff about curriculum
inconsistency in staffing and staff and child attendance due to covid
inconsistency in staffing and child attendance due to covid
The lead teacher seems overwhelmed due to ongoing staffing and internal communication issues. She does not get a consistent planning time and does not have a set time to meet with the second teacher to plan. I observed small groups during Center Time and suggestions for the logistics of small group time were met with resistance. There was little reflection of the curriculum during the time I was observing (one connected Center).
"some hesitance to incorporate a math small group time each week, but we discussed how it could work within their existing schedule; tone with children was better"
limiting whole group time to under 10 minutes and noticing when children are losing focus/interest (classroom management)
"The year is still not updated at the beginning of the form. Still has 2020 & 2021
First visit in awhile since COVID"
This. is a classroom without seats. They have had a number of cases of COVID so I have not been there to observe. We had a Zoom call to answer questions about Focus and classroom design. Most of my support up until this has been about getting their EEC license with admin.
Due to ABCD not letting anyone in their programs due to the covid uptick it has been a long time since I have observed.  ABCD just began to let anyone back in the programs in including their own coaches.  
Nikki one of the co teachers can be very negative to feedback she is given.  It takes her time to process things.  Once she processes it and sees the why then she seems better.  The instructional team is still trying to figure out their place in the classroom and how they can work cohesively togethere.
