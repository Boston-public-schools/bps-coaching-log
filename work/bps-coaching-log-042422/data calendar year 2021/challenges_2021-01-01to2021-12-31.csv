Briefly describe challenges in the classroom and/or your interaction with the instructional team in this session:
none
"The teacher had been in a car accident recently. She was experiencing anxiety and both having trouble completing some of the course assignments and forgetting songs in SWPL and other aspects of the day. We talked about taking time in the day to both relax and take a step back and breathe (15/20 mins), and to do some of the assignments (10 min) in pieces not to get too caught up in reading a whole article in one sitting. Also, creating a visual schedule for SWPL or other components so to not forget what is planned or coming next (e.g. a picture of a duck for the 5 little duck song, or a pictures of a frog for 5 green speckled frogs). "
none
Nothing from them.  Just feel like I could do more if I were in the room with them.
Nothing today.

Ashlee is subbing and not sure of future status of lead teacher
none
There were no challenges.
New team. New dynamics. 
mentioned above...
na
interactions with staff are good. Instruction is ongoing in terms of improvement. Few children in attendance
team recently enrolled a student or some students who have opted for remote learning. The teaching team decided to have all children attend certain components on their tablet. 
"Though teachers seem willing, they at times also seem confused about how to do certain things especially when it comes to classroom management. "
none.. 
N/A 
No challenge at this time.
There was a bit of push back on suggestions made by me in regards to if T&F was a time to pull out vocabulary from children or should that be done at the center through rich conversation or if there should be two students presenting their work within that 10 minute time frame.
audio quality-difficult to hear clearly at times
None
The teaching team is very receptive. There are no challenges at this time.
just tech issues with their computer for debrief...Nefira had to get very close to the computer for me to hear her
"Low enrollment. 9 enrolled but have never observed more than 3 in the classroom
One teacher in the room at a time"
"Most suggestions/encouragements given are met with resistance from the lead teacher. For example, when I encouraged them to use the small group record sheets or another form of documenting learning during small groups, she responded that she knows what kids can and can't do. There was also pushback around the structure of small group time (running 2 different teacher led groups at once)...hoping some of this can be addressed with ed supervisor and when coaching in person"
difficult to hear conversations between children and teachers
None
"Teachers are very aware of covid policies but are struggling to implement them at certain times of the day center, small groups. "
"Few children enrolled, more choice "
no
none
There are no challenges to be addressed at this time.
classroom was flooded/ teaching team does not have access to materials 
coaching thinking through a hybrid model. 
none

Just the spotty wifi.
None 
There was some wifi spottiness so hearing the interactions with the children was tough.
continued concerns about the challenging behavior of one child and how it interrupts learning/classroom functioning-not something I've seen in observations 
none
Some reluctance to have children act out their own stories...to try recommended protocols/routines for story acting
none
unclear how much planning/effort they've put into incorporating this component
very small group (no more than 3-4 chidden and one teacher)
There are no challenges at this time.
Ezzine had her baby and is out on maternity leave.
none
none
internet access on phones makes observation difficult
none
"We will continue to work on adjusting practice for students who need more support and others who are either adjusting with coming back to the classroom, or need more scaffolding."
None at the moment.
internet was spotty today so screen kept freezing. Not able to do debrief at noon because internet went down
There are no challenges at this time.
space and # of children with Covid restrictions
"team planning seems to be an issue. The visit was postponed from last week as the Assistant Teacher didn't have the book for the read aloud. The lead teacher did not attend the debrief because I had observed the Assistant reading. I need to follow up with both, together, on the importance of team prep and planning time and on the expectation that the lead teacher attend all debrief meetings."
Willfind ways to include other two asst. teachers  in debrief when they are with the children. Maybe once a month with all three staff at a different time of the day
There is a lack of collaboration and team work between the lead teacher and the assistant teacher. 
none
none
none
"It's unclear how much the lead teacher is committed to curriculum implementation. She received new teacher PD last year, but seems to be unfamiliar with a lot of the expectations and is not fully implementing curriculum components. She often pushes back on suggestions "
teacher seems hesitant to involve UPK related service staff in her work with this child and in making referrals in general. She seemed unaware of mental/behavioral health supports available for children and families in the program (I will follow up with admin next week)
none
none
none
lead teacher sometimes overly critical of herself
none.. strong team
small group-2 children attending regularly and both are English Language Learners-engagement can be challenging at times during remote learning
none
"internet during debrief was in and out, so we couldn't complete our discussion. Also, Nefira entered the meeting late because of coverage issues."
There have been scheduling changes frequently due to staff being out when observations or debriefs are scheduled.
At the moment the Dorchester classroom is moving to the new Roxbury site so we had to take pause on observations and debriefs.  
None
not clear if they are invested in story acting piece or clearly understand expectations-we made a plan for me to model story acting outside later in May
Using appropriate and efficient techniques to transition children from one activity to another. 
none
They are going to dedicate one day a week to planning but this is difficult because they are not receiving dedicated planning time together.  
Teachers expressed frustration with leadership.  They have concerns about covid regulations not being fully implemented within the program and are doing thier best to control it within their own classroom.

lack of support by admin.

When talking to Shirley she seems very receptive to feedback but when following through she does not seem to misinterpret the feedback.  There is a slight language barrier. Her first language is Haitian Creole.  
Fully understanding the intentionality behind small groups.  She needs a lot of support with executing the activity.   
"Understanding of curriculum specifically using the correct vocabulary, and concepts.  "

working unscheduling issues so all three staff can be present for debrief at least twice this year. 
Teachers are frustrated with admin support. 
"Now that children are back five days a week, some talk about room arrangement"
none
There are no challenges at this time.
none
"the teacher often has questions about UPK PD-certificates, expectations, clarity around attendance, etc. It isn't a challenge with her so much, but I feel like we need a clear system in place around PD attendance, tracking, and certificates."
"the lead  teacher has not been very receptive to coaching and feedback overall
The second teacher has been out with Covid for about a month so it's been hard for her to manage everything. She has had an assistant teacher with her, but she speaks limited English"
difficult to see everything in classroom. Sometimes internet freezes
none
None.  Just WIFI issues: freezing and sporadic sound.
No challenges noted!
none
Both Shirley and Oneyda need things about curriculum repeated multiple times.  Sometimes they misinterpret things because they are both 2nd language learners.  They do better with items being modeled for them.

Classroom management and dealing with children who have behavior issues seems the main challenges in this classroom.
none
none as of now
"lengthy whole group time in one classroom that required children to wait extensively
lead teacher in one classroom had to leave early to bring her daughter to the doctor"
"the program is short staffed, so I wasn't able to meet with the second teacher"
staffing-second teacher assigned to the classroom is leaving. The lead teacher is stressed by this. The classroom will need to move downstairs to accommodate the substitute who will be working with them.
Challenges in the classroom for the teachers was that there were children who were not engaging.  Class seemed to need more support in classroom management.
lead teacher defensive during feedback about some of the words she uses/interactions with children (e.g. play is for babies. You are big 3 and 4 year olds).
second teacher is new and needs more coaching on taking initiative and leading the group for whole group components
"the new second teacher in the room was let go the morning of the observation. The person hired to be the third teacher/floater, will take her place"
Two classrooms need more support in classroom management.  We are working on supporting those teachers so they can get deeper in the quality of teaching the curriculum.
Sherley has two children in her classroom that are being referred to for services.  She also has 7 children who are English Language Learners.  
Ms. Green has some challenging behaviors in here classroom.  She has connected with Cassandra and Jennifer from RS.  Jennifer is going to come in and do social stories with the class.  
N/A 
Half of the class is English Language Learners in their room.  
N/A 
There are lots of moving parts to the day.  The teachers expressed the need to continue looking more at Heggerty due to it being knew.  They feel they are overwhelmed.  
staffing-there is a temporary staff person serving as the second teacher
they didn't attend the Heggerty training...have been watching some of the videos
Team has been in place for awhile and complacency sets in. Working on cleaning and organizing environment. There was no break between summer and school year
Not all center areas are open.  Ms. T felt she needed to have structures in place and wanted to introduce them gradually.  She introduced block area during small groups.  I nicely encouraged her to quickly introduce all centers because this is a key part of the focus curriculum! 
"Classroom 6 is still looking for a full time second teacher. Peg is substituting for now. The classroom has been moved downstairs to accommodate Peg (stairs were too much). Nefira doesn't seem to be involved in the services being offered to her children-in the decision making/intake process or in consultation with outside service providers (e.g mental health, speech). This has been a source of frustration for her."
"staffing shortage has been a challenge at the program, making it difficult for me to meet with both members of the teaching team"
Working on environment/ classroom and organization
"The instructional teams class is half ELL.  This is challenging for the teachers and children during the daily routines, structures. "
The classroom does not have the read aloud books for them to begin the curriculum.  We did speak with Arlene the director and Claudine was sending her the book list to order.  Claudine dropped off Peter's Chair and Oonga Boonga for them to get started.  
Our debrief was via zoom due to coverage not being available for us to meet in person.
"They have not started curriculum yet.  RA text have not been ordered.  Some of the activities were not developmentally appropriate, there was not choose for where children wanted to go. Children were made to rotate through every centers every 15 minutes. Height of furniture was too high in blocks, DP.  They have a giant teacher desk in the room that needs to be removed.  A more clear set up for centers needs to be created (library, art easel).  No schedule posted, most of circle time area wall area has large calendar, months of the year, days of the week etc.  Staff/children interaction were weak. Work on walls was the same thing (This is my mom, This is my grandparent, this is me etc).  "
managing behavior can take up time during whole group meetings. We talked about ways to prevent behavior that can be disruptive and about taking a temperature check on the whole group-are most kids paying attention? Is a wiggly kid really distracting others?
"the second teacher has been absent for 2 weeks and the teacher has been teaching on her own. teacher practice in terms of tone, support for transitions, wait time when asking questions is sometimes concerning "
The challenges are that the teachers do not have time to plan with one another.  I will talk to admin about that so they can have a more cohesive work experience for each other.
Thinking about integrating Hebrew supports into Focus (ie. start with Read Aloud and vocabulary cards)
some resistance to feedback about the length of the whole group meeting time
There were no challenges during our meeting.
difficult to meet with all 3 teachers because of break schedules and staffing challenges (absent staff in other classrooms)
There is a buckling in the floor in their room which is getting worse and affects the layout. No response from landlord to repair. Will follow up after the holidays
moved ahead and started unit 3 without an extension week
There are none.  
"There have been covid, out of state visitors, and holidays that have caused a slow up in coaching this year."
"due to staffing shortage, the second teacher couldn't join the debrief session"
