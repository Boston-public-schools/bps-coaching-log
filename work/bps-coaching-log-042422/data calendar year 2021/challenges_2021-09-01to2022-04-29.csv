Briefly describe challenges in the classroom and/or your interaction with the instructional team in this session:
none
none as of now
"lengthy whole group time in one classroom that required children to wait extensively
lead teacher in one classroom had to leave early to bring her daughter to the doctor"
"the program is short staffed, so I wasn't able to meet with the second teacher"
staffing-second teacher assigned to the classroom is leaving. The lead teacher is stressed by this. The classroom will need to move downstairs to accommodate the substitute who will be working with them.
Challenges in the classroom for the teachers was that there were children who were not engaging.  Class seemed to need more support in classroom management.
lead teacher defensive during feedback about some of the words she uses/interactions with children (e.g. play is for babies. You are big 3 and 4 year olds).
second teacher is new and needs more coaching on taking initiative and leading the group for whole group components
"the new second teacher in the room was let go the morning of the observation. The person hired to be the third teacher/floater, will take her place"
Two classrooms need more support in classroom management.  We are working on supporting those teachers so they can get deeper in the quality of teaching the curriculum.
Sherley has two children in her classroom that are being referred to for services.  She also has 7 children who are English Language Learners.  
Ms. Green has some challenging behaviors in here classroom.  She has connected with Cassandra and Jennifer from RS.  Jennifer is going to come in and do social stories with the class.  
N/A 
Half of the class is English Language Learners in their room.  
N/A 
There are lots of moving parts to the day.  The teachers expressed the need to continue looking more at Heggerty due to it being knew.  They feel they are overwhelmed.  
staffing-there is a temporary staff person serving as the second teacher
they didn't attend the Heggerty training...have been watching some of the videos
Team has been in place for awhile and complacency sets in. Working on cleaning and organizing environment. There was no break between summer and school year
Not all center areas are open.  Ms. T felt she needed to have structures in place and wanted to introduce them gradually.  She introduced block area during small groups.  I nicely encouraged her to quickly introduce all centers because this is a key part of the focus curriculum! 
"Classroom 6 is still looking for a full time second teacher. Peg is substituting for now. The classroom has been moved downstairs to accommodate Peg (stairs were too much). Nefira doesn't seem to be involved in the services being offered to her children-in the decision making/intake process or in consultation with outside service providers (e.g mental health, speech). This has been a source of frustration for her."
"staffing shortage has been a challenge at the program, making it difficult for me to meet with both members of the teaching team"
Working on environment/ classroom and organization
"The instructional teams class is half ELL.  This is challenging for the teachers and children during the daily routines, structures. "
The classroom does not have the read aloud books for them to begin the curriculum.  We did speak with Arlene the director and Claudine was sending her the book list to order.  Claudine dropped off Peter's Chair and Oonga Boonga for them to get started.  
Our debrief was via zoom due to coverage not being available for us to meet in person.
"They have not started curriculum yet.  RA text have not been ordered.  Some of the activities were not developmentally appropriate, there was not choose for where children wanted to go. Children were made to rotate through every centers every 15 minutes. Height of furniture was too high in blocks, DP.  They have a giant teacher desk in the room that needs to be removed.  A more clear set up for centers needs to be created (library, art easel).  No schedule posted, most of circle time area wall area has large calendar, months of the year, days of the week etc.  Staff/children interaction were weak. Work on walls was the same thing (This is my mom, This is my grandparent, this is me etc).  "
managing behavior can take up time during whole group meetings. We talked about ways to prevent behavior that can be disruptive and about taking a temperature check on the whole group-are most kids paying attention? Is a wiggly kid really distracting others?
"the second teacher has been absent for 2 weeks and the teacher has been teaching on her own. teacher practice in terms of tone, support for transitions, wait time when asking questions is sometimes concerning "
The challenges are that the teachers do not have time to plan with one another.  I will talk to admin about that so they can have a more cohesive work experience for each other.
Thinking about integrating Hebrew supports into Focus (ie. start with Read Aloud and vocabulary cards)
some resistance to feedback about the length of the whole group meeting time
There were no challenges during our meeting.
difficult to meet with all 3 teachers because of break schedules and staffing challenges (absent staff in other classrooms)
There is a buckling in the floor in their room which is getting worse and affects the layout. No response from landlord to repair. Will follow up after the holidays
moved ahead and started unit 3 without an extension week
There are none.  
"There have been covid, out of state visitors, and holidays that have caused a slow up in coaching this year."
"due to staffing shortage, the second teacher couldn't join the debrief session"
