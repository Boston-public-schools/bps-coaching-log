The teachers in the room are very intentional on their interactions with the children around them. They make connections to the unit as they interact and extend conversations with children they are working with.
Teachers are very engaging and give children space to struggle but also scaffolds when needed.
"The teams are really thinking about how to teach 3 yr olds next year.  They are trying to decide if they should have 3 yr olds in one class or blended with the 4 yr olds.
The lead teachers have been given more responsibility as they are looking for a director, and they are really stepping up to their roles."
The teachers have a very nurturing relationship with the students.  They allow for freedom of choice within the classroom.
There are now three teachers in the room that allowed for children to be able to work with an adult in three centers.  The children were able to all go at the same time to their choice and there were no tears in where they went. Some students did have to work with a teacher at a small group area (patterns & making dough) but it was not a challenge for those who went with a teacher.
The interactions among teachers and students were positive with a great deal of positive praise and encouragement for students. There was an adult seated at three of the centers. The activities were prepared with the teacher modeling one for the group.

Great teaching team! 
Elizabeth has made a great transition to lead teacher.  The two other teachers in her room look to her for direct guidance.  I suggested having them read the lesson prior to doing them.  The three of them have great respect for each other. 
Elizabeth is trouble shooting how she does small groups.  She wanted me to come in today and observe trying to do small groups during centers.  We had talked about trying this at our last check in on March 18.  She is going to continue doing them during a separate time.  We both found it extremely difficult to facilitate centers and small groups at the same time.  
The teaching team works extremely well together!  They are not being coached on curriculum but are being coached on providing feedback to other teachers in the center.
